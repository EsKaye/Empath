*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (ðŸŽ¯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (âš¡) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ 95% confidence â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ Chain of thought analysis â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

Cross-reference with @memories.md and @lessons-learned.md for context and best practices.`

# Mode: PLAN ðŸŽ¯
Current Task: Refactor, upgrade, and push EmPath project to GitHub
Understanding: 
- EmPath is an AI-powered empathy companion with business advisory features
- Current tech stack: React + Vite, TypeScript, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, Mistral AI
- Project needs modernization, code organization, and GitHub deployment
- User wants comprehensive refactoring and upgrades before pushing to GitHub

Questions:
1. What specific GitHub repository name and description would you prefer for the project?
2. Are there any specific features or improvements you'd like me to prioritize during the refactoring?
3. Do you want me to set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD, or just push the initial codebase?
4. Should I create a comprehensive documentation structure including API docs, architecture diagrams, and deployment guides?
5. Are there any specific accessibility or performance improvements you'd like me to focus on?

Confidence: 85%
Next Steps:
- [ID-001] Analyze current codebase structure and identify refactoring opportunities
- [ID-002] Upgrade dependencies to latest stable versions
- [ID-003] Implement modern React patterns and best practices
- [ID-004] Enhance TypeScript types and interfaces
- [ID-005] Improve component architecture and separation of concerns
- [ID-006] Add comprehensive error handling and loading states
- [ID-007] Implement proper accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- [ID-008] Optimize performance with React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback
- [ID-009] Create comprehensive documentation structure
- [ID-010] Set up GitHub repository and push code
- [ID-011] Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD (optional)
- [ID-012] Create deployment documentation and guides

Status: Active
Last Updated: [v1.0.0] Initial planning phase
